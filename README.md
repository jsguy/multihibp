# Multi HIBP email builder

http://jsguy.github.io/multihibp/

This is an email-builder that allows you to check multiple email addresses, and then generate an email that you can send to any affected email addresses, (BCC'd of course), and inform them to visit hibp in order to see what accounts they need to reset their passwords for. The main idea is for email admins to be able to easily check a bunch of email addresses, and quickly email the affected users - it cans also be equally useful for checking your friends and family email addresses.
